During this project, I faced several challenges, primarily related to the complexity of TEI customization and encoding rules. Through the process, I discovered that TEI is both highly powerful and highly detailed: it allows for precise semantic markup, intertextual references, and structural constraints, but requires careful planning to avoid conflicts or validation errors. Comparing my approach from Assignment 1 to the current project, my understanding evolved from simply marking up text to designing a reusable and consistent encoding framework. I learned to balance strictness (required attributes, controlled vocabularies) with flexibility (optional elements, unbounded sequences).
Strategies that helped me succeed included building small pilot encodings, testing each change with the RNG validator, consulting TEI documentation extensively, and iteratively refining the ODD based on real examples. I also tried to go upside down, reshaping my encoded text as I made new ODD customization discoveries. I did not hesitated to change the timeline, go further to step backwards. These turnarounds helped me manage this long term project with a constantly renewed interest.
Learning TEI and managing this project made me generally understand how hypothesis and abstract analytical concepts can be translated in very tangible datas (machine-readable datas more especially), as my knowledge of digital literary criticism was at least superficial. I think I have approached a greater comprehension of how litterature is in fact structured and structurable, working on some examples I personnaly know deeply and love a lot, I think that it gave me a new perspective on how to analyse thought. In some ways, I conceived a schema with an idea of what I wanted to highlight, but working on this schema revealed unsuspected richness.
