# Artaud-Paulhan XML Encoding Project

## Overview
This repository contains the XML encoding project for Antonin Artaud’s correspondence with Jean Paulhan, produced as part of the final evaluation for the “Modelling Humanities Data with XML TEI” course. 

## Contents
The project is structured around:

- **Three TEI-encoded letters**  
- **Two external lists**: one for persons and one for places  
- **A customized ODD** defining the schema  
- **A Relax NG (RNG)** generated from the ODD for validation  
- **An HTML version of the ODD** for human-readable documentation  

## Customization
The ODD has been customized to reflect project-specific rules, including required attributes, controlled vocabularies, and sequences of elements. These modifications ensure consistent markup across the corpus while capturing semantic, intertextual, and structural features.

## Usage
Users can validate the XML texts against the RNG or consult the HTML ODD to understand the applied constraints and encoding conventions.

## AI usage statement
I used AI only to spot precise problems and to understand some error messages.
